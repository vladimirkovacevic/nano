0	9606.ENSP00000359787	9606	Homo sapiens	IFI44L	Interferon-induced protein 44-like; Exhibits a low antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus. Belongs to the IFI44 family.	0.0
1	9606.ENSP00000343428	9606	Homo sapiens	GPR18	N-arachidonyl glycine receptor; Receptor for endocannabinoid N-arachidonyl glycine (NAGly). However, conflicting results about the role of NAGly as an agonist are reported. Can also be activated by plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoid agonists. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. May contribute to regulation of the immune system. Is required for normal homeostasis of CD8+ subsets of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) (CD8alphaalpha and CD8alphabeta IELs)in small intstine by supporting preferential migration of CD8alphaalpha T-cells [...] 	0.0
2	9606.ENSP00000401645	9606	Homo sapiens	SERPINB2	Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2; Inhibits urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The monocyte derived PAI-2 is distinct from the endothelial cell-derived PAI-1; Belongs to the serpin family. Ov-serpin subfamily.	0.0
3	9606.ENSP00000354822	9606	Homo sapiens	XAF1	XIAP-associated factor 1; Seems to function as a negative regulator of members of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) family. Inhibits anti-caspase activity of BIRC4. Induces cleavage and inactivation of BIRC4 independent of caspase activation. Mediates TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and is involved in apoptosis in trophoblast cells. May inhibit BIRC4 indirectly by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. After translocation to mitochondria, promotes translocation of BAX to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Seems to promote the redistribution of BIRC4 fr [...] 	0.0
4	9606.ENSP00000357022	9606	Homo sapiens	SLAMF7	SLAM family member 7; Self-ligand receptor of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family. SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. Isoform 1 mediates NK cell activation through a SH2D1A-independent extracellular signal-regulated ERK-me [...] 	0.0
5	9606.ENSP00000264170	9606	Homo sapiens	KYNU	Kynureninase; Catalyzes the cleavage of L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) and L-3- hydroxykynurenine (L-3OHKyn) into anthranilic acid (AA) and 3- hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-OHAA), respectively. Has a preference for the L-3-hydroxy form. Also has cysteine-conjugate-beta-lyase activity. Belongs to the kynureninase family.	0.0
6	9606.ENSP00000391592	9606	Homo sapiens	PTPN6	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 6; Modulates signaling by tyrosine phosphorylated cell surface receptors such as KIT and the EGF receptor/EGFR. The SH2 regions may interact with other cellular components to modulate its own phosphatase activity against interacting substrates. Together with MTUS1, induces UBE2V2 expression upon angiotensin II stimulation. Plays a key role in hematopoiesis.	0.0
7	9606.ENSP00000231461	9606	Homo sapiens	ST8SIA4	CMP-N-acetylneuraminate-poly-alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase; Catalyzes the polycondensation of alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid required for the synthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), which is present on the embryonic neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), necessary for plasticity of neural cells.	0.0
8	9606.ENSP00000497271	9606	Homo sapiens	IFIH1	Interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1; Innate immune receptor which acts as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids and plays a major role in sensing viral infection and in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses including the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Its ligands include mRNA lacking 2'-O-methylation at their 5' cap and long- dsRNA (>1 kb in length). Upon ligand binding it associates with mitochondria antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/IPS1) which activates the IKK-related kinases: TBK1 and IKBKE which phosphorylat [...] 	0.0
9	9606.ENSP00000263341	9606	Homo sapiens	IL1B	Interleukin-1 beta; Potent proinflammatory cytokine. Initially discovered as the major endogenous pyrogen, induces prostaglandin synthesis, neutrophil influx and activation, T-cell activation and cytokine production, B- cell activation and antibody production, and fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. Promotes Th17 differentiation of T-cells. Synergizes with IL12/interleukin-12 to induce IFNG synthesis from T- helper 1 (Th1) cells.	0.0
10	9606.ENSP00000358983	9606	Homo sapiens	NFKB2	Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p100 subunit; NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain- containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the indi [...] 	0.0
